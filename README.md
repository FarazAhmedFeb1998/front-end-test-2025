### Introduction

You've been presented with a small project which you know nothing about. Please fix all of the bugs and refactor where necessary.

- Refactor the `Users.tsx` render function to use the `UserCard` and `UserCardHeader` components.
- Currently we're rendering the user's full name. Please render their username instead.
- Fix the users API query. We're requesting 5 users when calling the function, why are 10 being rendered?
- Extract the user filtering logic to a custom hook
- Our users need to be able to use this web app on their smartphones, please make the layout responsive.
- Fix any other bugs or performance issues which you find in the codebase.
